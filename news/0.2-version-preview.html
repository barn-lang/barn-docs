        New version of barn (0.2v) will have in it these things:<br>
		<ul class="news-list-content">
			<li>
				New type system, that's more parser thing we will just add better understandment of types
				in parser
			</li>
			<li>
				Change the statements look so insted of<br>
				<div class="code">
					<code>
						if |1 == 1| {<br>
						&emsp;&emsp;print("1 is 1, easy lol")<br>
						}<br>
					</code>
				</div>
				We have something like this more modern and without some weird<br>
				characters, 'cause after all this time i see this syntax mistake<br>
				very well<br>
				<div class="code">
					<code>
						if (1 == 1) {<br>
						&emsp;&emsp;print("1 is 1, easy lol")<br>
						}<br>
					</code>
				</div>
			</li>
			<li>
				Also now for will look like this<br>
				<div class="code">
					<code>
						for (let i: int = 0; i < 100; i++) { {<br>
						&emsp;&emsp;print("printing this hundred times")<br>
						}<br>
					</code>
				</div>
			  	So if, while, for look this same<br>
			</li>
			<li>
				Better Standard library, in 0.1v this library is very very obscured
				and don't have all of the important functions, in 0.2v i want to 
				expand built in libraries so you can do everything what you do in
				C or any normal programming language without injecting C into Barn
			</li>
			<li>
				Fix codegen, actually codegen is only one thing that is written pretty
				good in whole barn but there's still some things that are not working well
			</li>
			<li>
				Speeeeeeed, barn was suppose to be the fastes language in the world, it is
				but not the fastes of course. The speed in barn is not that tragic but not
				the best over all
			</li>
			<li>
				Fix that we can call functions inside the math expressions that is the biggest
				bug in the barn and lots of people are terrified with it, i'm saying about this:

					<div class="code">
						<code>
							fun get_int() int {<br>
							&emsp;&emsp;return 1<br>
							}<br><br>
							fun main() {<br>
							&emsp;&emsp;let the_int: int = get_int() // This will work<br>
							&emsp;&emsp;let the_int2: int = get_int() + 1 // But this wouldn't<br>
							}<br>
						</code>
					</div>
			</li>
			<li>
				Auto type in variables, so we don't need to write the type after let we will just
				recognize the type by ourself
			</li>
			<li>
				Other micro changes
			</li>
		</ul>
		That's all we want to add to barn, if you want to help us in implementing all of it write to
		me on discord, I will help you in getting into the source code!!

		Version 0.2 soon, this update is a big step to getting barn working better and maybe
		getting out from beta!
